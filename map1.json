Next to you is a small table with a <span style='color:red'>book</span>. Next to the book there is a small <span style='color:red'>glass</span> that contains some yellow liquid in it.  On the other side of the room there is a <span style='color:red'>fireplace</span>. There is no window in the room, but a small wooden <span style='color:red'>door</span>, which hopefully leads out of this place.",
